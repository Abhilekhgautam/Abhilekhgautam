I am *Abhilekh Gautam* from Nepal.
Programming is my hobby these day. I like writing C++. Recently I have
started learning the Rust Programming language. I am interested in System Programming
and currently working on my hobby compiler project. However I am into backend web development as well.

Beside programming I like reading books (Currently reading the *The Dragon Book*) I have found my interest in technical writing as well, 
I have written more than
a dozen article related to computer programming that are published online.
